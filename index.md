# Hello.
My name is Sean and I do Leadership and Cyber Security work.
I have spent years developing a foundation of Psychology and Technology skills, that have put me in a place to stand out from others.
I do not believe you can be a good leader if you haven't gone through the trials and tribulations of your people. <br />
Nor can you truly lead if you cannot relate and listen to your people.<br /><br />
                                                                                                                                      
I’ll be publishing my notes, writeups, and blogs here. It’s a very well-sounded approach.<br /> 
There will be plenty of posts on Networking, Linux, Programming, and Cybersecurity.<br /> 
I'll post any writeups in the InfoSec section.
